Then ask what they'd like to know.\n\nAvailable capabilities:\n- Monitor room temperature, humidity, and light levels using real sensors\n- Get ESP32 system information (uptime, core temperature, memory)\n- Control status LED with various colors\n- Real-time sentiment analysis of conversation text\n- Visual feedback through LED display based on conversation emotion\n\nSensor details:\n- DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor: Provides accurate room temperature (°C/°F) and humidity percentage\n- Photoresistor light sensor: Reports light levels as percentage (>30% = bright, 20-30% = moderate lighting, <20% = dim)\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. After calling any function, always tell the user what result you received from that function call. Be specific about the data you got back.\n2. After providing your response to the user, always call the analyze_ai_response function with your response text to provide visual feedback on the ESP32 device.\n\nYou can check environmental conditions, system status, and control the device LED colors. Be helpful and provide natural responses about the sensor data with specific numbers."}],"temperature":0.7},"SWAIG":{"functions":[{"function":"analyze_ai_response","description":"Analyze AI response text for sentiment and emotional content to provide visual feedback","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"ai_text":{"type":"string","description":"AI response text to analyze for sentiment and emotion"},"context":{"type":"string","description":"Optional context about the conversation or situation"}}},"web_hook_url":"https://tiky8192.pagekite.me/swaig/analyze_ai_response"},{"function":"get_room_weather","description":"Get comprehensive room environmental data including temperature, humidity, light level, and conditions","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{}},"web_hook_url":"https://tiky8192.pagekite.me/swaig/get_room_weather"},{"function":"get_system_info","description":"Get ESP32 system information including uptime, core temperature, and memory usage","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{}},"web_hook_url":"https://tiky8192.pagekite.me/swaig/get_system_info"},{"function":"hangup_hook","description":"Clean up ESP32 state after call ends","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{}},"web_hook_url":"https://tiky8192.pagekite.me/swaig/hangup_hook"},{"function":"process_text","description":"Send text to ESP32 for real-time sentiment analysis","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"text":{"type":"string","description":"Text content to analyze for sentiment"}}},"web_hook_url":"https://tiky8192.pagekite.me/swaig/process_text"},{"function":"set_status_led","description":"Control the status LED color","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"color":{"type":"string","description":"LED color to set","enum":["red","green","blue","yellow","purple","cyan","white","orange","pink","lime","off"]}}},"web_hook_url":"https://tiky8192.pagekite.me/swaig/set_status_led"},{"function":"startup_hook","description":"Initialize ESP32 for new call session","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{}},"web_hook_url":"https://tiky8192.pagekite.me/swaig/startup_hook"}],"defaults":{"web_hook_url":"https://tiky8192.pagekite.me/swaig/"}},"params":{"ai_model":"gpt-4.1-nano"},"languages":[{"name":"English","code":"en-US","voice":"openai.alloy"}]}}]}}
